            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>His then Majeſty's neglecting to Aſſiſt the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> under great Perſecutions for their <hi>Religion,</hi> was more than a Tacit Conſent to their <hi>Utter Extirpation.</hi> His Intail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Duke of York</hi> upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contrary to the Deſires and Endeavours of Three <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and that not out of Love to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but Affection to Popery, which he knew that Prince was engag'd

            <p>'Twas by a ſtrange <hi>Providence,</hi> as well as great <hi>Overſight</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the late King, that we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at this Diſcovery; for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Men that believ'd the <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Oaths</hi> his Majeſty, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second had ſwallow'd, and thought it impoſſible he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate in ſo <hi>ſolemn</hi> a Matter, were ſo fix'd in their Opinions of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s being a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and ſo Outragious againſt them that durſt but <hi>whiſper</hi> the contrary, that had it not been for his <hi>Receiving Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Extream Unction, from a Popiſh Prieſt, a little before his Death; and for what he left in Writing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own Hand;</hi> he would ſtill have paſs'd for a <hi>True</hi> Proteſtant; and the Nation, in favour of that Monarch; would have ſtill been kept under their former Deluſions.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44281:8"/>Tho', at the ſame time, it gives us but an <hi>Indifferent</hi> Character of this <hi>Prince,</hi> who, for the Lucre of a <hi>Crown,</hi> thus notoriouſly diſſembled with God and Man; and that in all his <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Speeches</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in Complying in the <hi>Offices,</hi> and in Communicating in the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he wore the Vizor of a Proteſtant, when he was a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was by Oath, when he chang'd his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſet up Popery!

Reſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and therefore proceed to ſhew what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods were taken by him, to Erect thoſe <hi>Idols,</hi> and ſubvert our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> and they were principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Four: <hi>Firſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By Abuſing the <hi>Credulity</hi> of the Nation, with the fond Hopes of ſuch Privileges and Immunities, as were never intended them. Of this kind was his <hi>Declaration from Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> which promis'd <hi>Indulgence and Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that would live peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Civil Government; But if we had look'd before us, and not ſuffer'd our Prejudices againſt the many late <hi>Mock-Governments,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of our Fellow-Subjects, and the Tranſports of being deliver'd from them, in the Acceſſion of the Rightful King to his Throne, to have blinded our Eyes, we might eaſily have perceiv'd, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his Thoughts to perform it: For, the Previous Obligations he was under, to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> had a Virtue to Superſede, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul, his Engagements to <hi>Engliſh He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> So that all he Intended by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44281:10"/>
that <hi>Declaration,</hi> was, to Tye up the Hands; and Lull thoſe into a Tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Admitting his Return into his Dominions, whom a Jealouſie of being afterwards <hi>perſecuted</hi> for their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> might have awaken'd, to withſtand and diſpute it, 'till they had better Security. And ſo it came to paſs; for he was no ſooner ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Throne of his Anceſtors, and ſaw himſelf ſecure, but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd himſelf from every thing that the <hi>Royal</hi> Word, and Faith of a Prince, had oblig'd him to perform. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By Sowing <hi>Diſcord, Dividing</hi> Proteſtants, Alienating their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Imbittering their Minds one againſt another; that being ſo Divided, and Enrag'd, they might contribute to each other's Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or, by weakning their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, become an eaſie Prey to the Fury of Papiſts. And truly, nothing but an <hi>Early</hi> Proſpect of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod could have Embolden'd <hi>King Charles</hi> to enterprize upon our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Liberties,</hi> and the Reform'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> For, tho' there have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Differences among them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44281:10"/>
               <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and about <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of Divine Worſhip; yet they always accorded in <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in the Preſervation of their Natural and Legal <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> as well as in a Common Deteſtation of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and the Siniſter Arts of promoting them; But when theſe Fiery Bombs of a Popiſh Court, were by various Hands, thrown among Proteſtants, all went to wrack by our fatal Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and ſuch an <hi>Unlimited</hi> Power was thruſt into the Hands of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> over our Lives, Religion, Laws, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Liberties, that if his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous</hi> Intrigues, and <hi>Careleſs</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, had not diverted him, he had certainly arriv'd at that Pitch of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that he aſpir'd after; and had laid all his Subjects at the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of the Monarch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next Expedient that King <hi>Charles</hi> employ'd, to accompliſh his Deſign, was, <hi>Encouraging and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Papiſts</hi> upon every Occaſion, when it might be done without an open Reflexion on himſelf, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44281:11"/>
and yet, ſometimes he broke through thoſe Maxims alſo; tho' one would have thought their Intolerable Inſolencies, on every Gleam of Royal Favour, might have juſtly check'd his Clemency. Inſtances of his particular Reſpects for that People might be eaſily giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but becauſe it will be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly diſcours'd in his <hi>Succeſſor</hi>'s Reign, I ſhall give but Two here, and thoſe were, <hi>His Conniving at their Increaſe, and Executing the Laws with greateſt Rigour againſt Proteſtant-Diſſenters; giving private Inſtructions to his Judges, to ſtifle the Execution of the Laws againſt Popiſh Recuſants, tho' directly levell'd againſt them, and but by a forc'd Conſtruction, inflicted upon Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But the laſt, and moſt <hi>Effectual Stratagem,</hi> for the Service of this King's <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Ends, was, Tying all his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Promotions</hi> to the Preaching up <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance:</hi> And in this he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo <hi>unluckily,</hi> that thoſe who refus'd to comply with this <hi>Upſtart Doctrine,</hi> were ſcarce reckon'd among the Number of Chriſtians; whilſt a

               <hi>little Court-Zealot,</hi> that had nothing elſe to recommend him, but a Blind Obedience to the Orders of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> in Preaching up this <hi>Slaviſh Doctrine,</hi> was Dignify'd with the Title of <hi>a True Son of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Loaded</hi> with Preferments.</p>
            <p>Into what a doleful Condition was this Nation reduc'd, when <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> was forc'd to truckle to New-invented <hi>Politicks,</hi> and our <hi>Laws</hi> were Brib'd into a Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves? Now both <hi>Pulpit</hi> and <hi>Preſs</hi> were Surfeited with ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was a Government by Divine Right; That it was in the Prince's Power to Rule as he pleaſes; That it was a Grace and Condeſcention in the King to Govern by Laws; That for Parliaments to Direct or Regulate the Succeſſion, border'd upon Treaſon, and was an Offence againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, That the only Benefit left to Subjects, in caſe the King will Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over their Conſciences, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Eſtates, is, tamely to ſuffer, and,</hi> as they Abſurdly expreſs'd it, <hi>to Exerciſe Paſſive Obedience.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44281:12"/>Thus were Minds, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, of the Subjects corrupted with ſuch Peſtilent and <hi>Slaviſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that at length the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was betray'd into ſuch a Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and Inſenſibility of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>Legal Rights,</hi> that our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy</hi> was almoſt turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Abſolute Tyranny,</hi> and our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Privileges dwindl'd into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Under pretence of <hi>Preſerving the Church,</hi> too many of the <hi>Clergy</hi> gave themſelves over to an Implicit Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Court; and became, not only <hi>Advocates,</hi> but <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> for the Robbing Corporations of their <hi>Charters;</hi> Impoſing <hi>Sheriffs</hi> upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> who were not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally Elected; and of <hi>Fining</hi> and puniſhing Men <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> for no Crime, ſave their having, by Modeſt and Lawful Ways, Aſſerted their Own, and the Nations Rights.</p>
            <p>Under pretence of Jealouſie of the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> they became <hi>Tools</hi> under this <hi>King,</hi> for Juſtifying the <hi>Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſo many <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion made upon their Privileges, the Ridiculing and Stifling <hi>Popiſh

Plots,</hi> the Shamming of Forg'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies upon Proteſtants; the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning</hi> of ſeveral Men to Death, for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> who could be Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Guilty</hi> by the Tranſgreſſion of no <hi>Known</hi> Law; and finally, for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the <hi>Duke of York into the Throne,</hi> who was engag'd in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Government;</hi> and whom Three ſeveral <hi>Parliaments,</hi> for thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, would have Excluded from the Succeſſion.

            <p>When I ſay, theſe Enormities were committed by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> I deſire not to be underſtood, as if I intended to comprehend all that <hi>Sacred Order</hi> under the Guilt of ſuch Raſh and Inconſiderate Deſigns; for there were many Good Men among them, who were ſo far from Sacrificing our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power,</hi> that they publickly declar'd their <hi>Diſ-likes,</hi> and <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of ſuch Extravagant Proceeding, tho' they wanted Power to ſtem the Torrent that was overflowing both <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and as ſoon as Providence miniſter'd an Occaſion, were the <hi>firſt</hi> that put to their Hands

of human Conſtitution, tho' their Power is from God Almighty. Nor does this opinion aim at the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy into an <hi>Elective</hi> Kingdom; but ſhews that there is no ſuch abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of keeping the <hi>Lineal Deſcent</hi> in reſpect of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſon, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be chang'd for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of a Kingdom, contrary to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who affirm from <hi>Hiſtory, Records,</hi> and <hi>Law-Books,</hi> that our Monarchy is <hi>Hereditary</hi> as to a Family, but Elective as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

Our Anceſtors perceiving
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44281:26"/>
that the way of <hi>Electing</hi> Kings was ſubject to many Inconveniencies, and often expos'd the Kingdom to <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, Interregnum's,</hi> and <hi>Revolutions,</hi> as well as to the <hi>ſeditious</hi> commotions of under-hand dealers, and the Pride and Ambition of Men too deſirous to be uppermoſt.

            <p>Of all Men living, the late <hi>King James,</hi> and his Defenders, have leaſt Reaſon to quarrel <hi>this Right by Law:</hi> For, How came it to paſs, that the Line of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> had a better <hi>Title</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than that of the <hi>Baliols;</hi> but only that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that is, <hi>the Conſent of the Eſtates of that Kingdom made them ſo?</hi> For, otherwiſe, if we ſearch into the <hi>Pedigrees</hi> of thoſe two <hi>Families,</hi> we ſhall find that <hi>Baliol,</hi> according to the common receiv'd Rules of <hi>Deſcent,</hi> was nearer in Blood to the laſt <hi>King David,</hi> than <hi>Bruce;</hi> and was ſo adjudg'd at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Hearing<note n="*" place="margin">Bak.

               <hi>were able to make a King as great and happy as he could deſire to be;</hi> and after that, I cannot imagine what he could wiſh for next. But,</p>

Humane Conſtitutions agreeable to Chriſtianity, and beneficial to Civil Societies.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if a King, by <hi>Lawful</hi> Succeſſion, ſhall act <hi>unlawfully;</hi> and inſtead of preſerving the <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil Rights</hi> of his Subjects, ſhall endeavour to deſtroy them, he may be ſet aſide, without Prejudice to the Conſtitution, ſince we are not oblig'd to preſerve the <hi>Right of the Succeſſion to the Deſtruction of the Kingdom. Fit,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> ought to over-rule <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and <hi>Formalities</hi> give way to the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the Publick. 'Twas a common Saying amongſt the late <hi>King James</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, that their King had a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right,</hi> and therefore he would not be a <hi>Slave</hi> to the <hi>Law:</hi> And there is greater Reaſon that his Subjects ſhould not be <hi>Slaves</hi> to a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> that broke them; nor <hi>Millions</hi> of Souls be ruin'd, to humour a <hi>Single</hi> Perſon.</p>
            <p>No pretended <hi>Right</hi> whatſoever can Legitimate <hi>Unlawful</hi> Practices; and therefore, when a King, <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whoſe Miniſter he is,</hi> degenerates into <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and deprives the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of all thoſe Bleſſings that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had given us the quiet Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of; I think there can be no <hi>Reaſon</hi> aſſign'd, why we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thoſe <hi>Violences</hi> any longer than till we are in a Capacity to help our ſelves. The Right of Succeſſion has been always Claim'd, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Enjoy'd; and the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> notwithſtanding this Claim, have ſet the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the Heads of thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> whom they knew had no <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> to it; and yet they have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd as <hi>Lawful</hi> Kings in all our <hi>Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> while thoſe who were <hi>next</hi> of Blood were laid Aſide, when the Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is to be conſider'd in the firſt, and chiefeſt place, makes it neceſſary ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Into what a lamentable Condition would this Kingdom have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, if the Law that <hi>Intails</hi> the Succeſſion on the Next in Blood, ſhould alſo give him a Power to do what he <hi>pleaſes,</hi> be it Right or Wrong!

               <hi>Nature</hi> has founded our Obedience upon a Suppoſition, that it was for the <hi>Good</hi> of the Community, and not otherwiſe: And would it not be a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> if Princes might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Authority beyond the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of its <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and attempt the Deſtruction of the Society, and we quietly ſubmit to whatever they pleas'd to do? I am as far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Perſons of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of this Nation to be <hi>Sacred,</hi> and <hi>Inviolable,</hi> as any Man living; yet, I dare not ſay they are to be <hi>Obey'd</hi> in All Caſes whatſoever; for then the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and the <hi>Bow-ſtring,</hi> would be the ſame; and we muſt owe our Lives to Fortune, not to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>What if a King ſhould take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Burning of <hi>Cities,</hi> Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Men,</hi> and Raviſhing <hi>Women;</hi> for ſuch Kings there have been in the World, and what has been, may be again?

Nature,</hi> have a <hi>greater</hi> Authority over their Children, than <hi>Kings</hi> have over their Subjects; and yet, if a Father comes to kill his Child, he is not oblig'd to <hi>ſubmit,</hi> and open his Breaſt to the <hi>Dagger;</hi> or hold up his <hi>Throat,</hi> whilſt his <hi>Father</hi> cuts it! No; <hi>Nature, Common Senſe, Self-preſervation, and the Practice of all Nations,</hi> is too powerful for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of ſuch Principles; and thoſe that cannot <hi>reaſon,</hi> can <hi>feel</hi> what they are to do in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, The King muſt be bereav'd of his <hi>Wits,</hi> that attempts the Deſtruction of his whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but grants that they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſtroy one Part, for the ſake of another; (as <hi>King James</hi>'s Deſign was, to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi>) but ſays, he ought not to be <hi>Obey'd</hi> in ſuch Frentick Depopulations. And if <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks the <hi>Prince Mad</hi> that attempts it, we may conclude them <hi>little</hi> better, that miſ-apply their Parts, to <hi>defend</hi> it: For, tho' the Scripture commands Obedience to Authority, without <hi>Exception;</hi> yet
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44281:31"/>
in Caſes of <hi>Certain, Apparent,</hi> and <hi>Extream Neceſſity,</hi> ſuch as ours was in the <hi>late</hi> Reign, it may as Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be preſum'd to be <hi>Excepted</hi> out of that General Rule, as Works of Mercy and Charity were allow'd upon the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> by our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour.</hi> 'Tis the Right of Kings, that we <hi>Obey</hi> them; and ſuffer <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Injuries, rather than deſtroy the <hi>Publick</hi> Peace: But 'tis <hi>the Right of God</hi> that we <hi>Diſobey</hi> them, when their Wills oppoſe his Divine Laws, or Common Safety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is dangerous to Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it inveſts them with a Power to do more than they <hi>Ought,</hi> which at one time or other will be turn'd upon themſelves; for where <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Terrour</hi> are the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Obedience,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> will be growing up: Men may bear the Yoke of Servile Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, for a while, with Patience; but if it galls their Shoulders by a ſharp and long Continuance, they will bethink themſelves how to throw it off: Therefore the Way for Princes to <hi>keep</hi> their Power, is, to exerciſe it with <hi>Lenity;</hi> and to graſp
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44281:31"/>
at no more, than what tends to the Subject's <hi>Eaſe,</hi> as well as their own <hi>Superiority</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>This makes a <hi>Prince</hi> Supream by his <hi>Virtue,</hi> as well as his <hi>Character;</hi> and ſo <hi>Indears</hi> his Subjects <hi>Duty,</hi> that he cannot raiſe his <hi>Thoughts</hi> above the Pitch of their <hi>Obedience:</hi> Whereas, if he acts like the late <hi>King James,</hi> and Inſiſts upon <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience without Reſerve,</hi> and will force a Neceſſary and <hi>Reciprocal</hi> Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Extremity of <hi>Slavery,</hi> it will put his Subjects into the ſame Humour, and learn them, by his Example, to exceed the Bounds of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. All Compulſary Methods, Indirect Courſes, and Stretches of Power, are a kind of <hi>Foul</hi> Play; and he that uſes it himſelf, does, by Implication, allow it thoſe he plays with; as the late King found, by a dear-bought Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mighty</hi> Nations may be upheld by <hi>Abſolute Power;</hi> but the Narrow Territories of <hi>England</hi> muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Juſtice, or the Door will be ſet open to the Next better Comer.

yet they perfectly hate <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;</hi> and as they were <hi>born</hi> Free, ſo they love to <hi>continue</hi> in that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Condition, as their <hi>Right,</hi> and not upon the <hi>Precarious</hi> Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Superiour Power.</p>

            <p>Inventing this Doctrine, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a Currency through the whole Land, look'd as if the Authors and Promoters of it were fiſhing for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients</hi>

They ſhew'd a <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> in their Impoſitions, and a <hi>Luxury</hi> in abuſing the Patience and Quietude of the Nation, till Vengeance overtook them. 'Tis the Scandal of <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> that they are fond of <hi>Novelties;</hi> and theſe State-Brokers were willing to keep up the Reproach in the higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: But, ſure, they could not, in their <hi>Lucid Intervals,</hi> imagine there was any Pleaſure in <hi>Iriſh Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres,</hi> or think that <hi>Wooden-Shooes</hi> would ſit eaſie on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Feet; and therefore were unkind in Tempting the late <hi>King</hi> to be Cruel, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations wanted no Spur to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his <hi>Zeal</hi> for our Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But to do theſe Sticklers all the Right we can, and yet ſilence them for ever, their <hi>Practices</hi> are the beſt Confutations of their <hi>Principles;</hi> for, tho' when other Men ſmarted, they felt no Pain; yet, when they ſaw Sacrilegious Hands ſeize their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,</hi> and that the <hi>Swords</hi> of their

            <p>
               <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> link'd with Paſſive Obedience, is but uſing <hi>more</hi> Words to expreſs the <hi>ſame</hi> thing; and I ſhould have wholly over-look'd it, as a <hi>Frivolous,</hi> if not a <hi>Ridiculous</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but that it gives me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to confute the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Inſlaving the Kingdom, by ſhewing,</p>

               <hi>That in Caſes of General, Evident, and Extream Neceſſity, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Kingdom, ſuch as ours was under the Dominion of the Late King</hi> James, <hi>'tis lawful for Subjects, in their own Defence, to oppoſe a King that would deſtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I have a very <hi>Tender</hi> Point to handle, leſt I ſhould ſeem to encourage <hi>Sedition,</hi> or humour thoſe <hi>that are given to Change;</hi> which is as far from my <hi>Intentions,</hi> and as contrary to my <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as the two Poles are diſtant one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

have all along reſtrain'd the Subjects <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> to Caſes of <hi>General, Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and <hi>Extream Neceſſity;</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be attempted, but upon ſuch Emergencies. To every <hi>Good King,</hi> and Lawful Government, we have as many Ties of <hi>Obedience,</hi> as there are Chriſtian <hi>Vertues;</hi> and he muſt Renounce his <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his <hi>Allegiance;</hi> for Obedience is a Duty which we <hi>Religiouſly</hi> owe to <hi>God,</hi> which we <hi>Naturally</hi> owe to our <hi>Parents,</hi> which we <hi>Morally</hi> owe to our <hi>Laws,</hi> and which we Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, Naturally and Legally owe our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> as he is <hi>God</hi>'s Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, <hi>Father</hi> of his Country, and our <hi>Liege</hi> Lord. This is the Prince's Due, and the Subject's Duty; and, to prevent Miſtakes, will be further explain'd in the following <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>True Engliſh</hi> Subject.</p>
            <p>He is one that Quietly, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, moves in his own Sphere, without Intermeddling in <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Secret</hi> Matters of <hi>State,</hi> that are out of his <hi>Reach,</hi> and Inconſiſtent with his <hi>Duty;</hi> that heartily Obeys the <hi>King,</hi> in all his Commands that do not thwart the Laws of <hi>God,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44281:34"/>
Nature, or his Country;</hi> that <hi>Honours, Loves</hi> and <hi>Defends</hi> the <hi>King's Perſon, Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Chearfully</hi> Contributes to the Support of his <hi>Government;</hi> that makes his <hi>Private</hi> Concerns ſtoop to the <hi>Publick</hi> Good, and Suſtains thoſe Loſſes with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> that he ſuffers for the <hi>Common</hi> Intereſt: One that can diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Slaviſh Fear,</hi> and <hi>Religious Obedience;</hi> betwixt the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and Cauſe of a <hi>whole Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Clamours</hi> and Diſcontents of a <hi>Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> and <hi>Incorrigible Faction:</hi> One that will be <hi>True</hi> to his <hi>King,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Falſe to his <hi>God,</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to his <hi>Country.</hi> And, to conclude, One that (like the Poet's Dyal) always ſtands <hi>True,</hi> tho' the Sun of <hi>Reward,</hi> or <hi>Favour,</hi> never ſhines upon him.</p>
            <p>In this Portraicture of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject in <hi>Little,</hi> you may ſee the whole Deſign of Chriſtianity on this Subject; which is, Keeping every thing within its <hi>proper</hi> Bounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Needleſs <hi>Increments,</hi> or Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Abatements</hi> of Royal Authority, which always terminate in Vanity, or <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> and conſequently,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44281:35"/>
are extreamly prejudicial to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi> and <hi>Detractor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the Evil in the Increaſe and Uſe of Power, that thoſe declaim againſt, who are for no more than a <hi>Legal</hi> Obedience; for <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> in its proper Latitude, has its true <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> with us, as much as any other <hi>Chriſtian Duty;</hi> and tho' we cannot ſwallow it ſo <hi>Glibly,</hi> as it was Adulterated in the late Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, (to ſerve a Temporizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, abſtracted from the Publick Good,) yet that does not hinder us from <hi>Digeſting</hi> it better, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it more <hi>Dutifully,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantly,</hi> than thoſe who were as Ready to Throw it up, as they were to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe</hi> it; or that ſtill <hi>Retain</hi> it, to do further Miſchief. And having thus ſecur'd our Loyalty and Fidelity to our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> under this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall re-aſſume the Argument for <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> when the Neceſſity of it is as <hi>Certain,</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> as ours was.</p>
            <p>All differing Perſons about <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> agree in this, That if a King is reſolutely bent to <hi>Deſtroy</hi> his Subjects, and that no <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44281:35"/>
alter his Purpoſe; but that he ſtocks himſelf with ſuch <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi> as will co-operate with him in the execution of his Tragical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; his Subjects may <hi>Deſert</hi> him, Decline his Government and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſeek <hi>Protection</hi> where they can find it. Of this Opinion is the Excellent <hi>Grotius, Barclay, Pufen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, Bodin,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Falkener.</hi> I confeſs they ſay the caſe is <hi>not</hi> to be put, as almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to happen; yet I think it but Reaſonable to ſuppoſe it here, becauſe I ſhall prove it in the Sequel beyond Contradiction, that the late King <hi>James</hi> was under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of deſtroying his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, that all his <hi>Actions</hi> openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and therefore may ſay, with the Author of <hi>Jovian,</hi> That 'twas <hi>Lawful to reſiſt him,</hi> ſince he himſelf has ſaid in the ſame Page, That he ſhould be tempted <hi>to pray for the Deſtruction of ſuch a Prince, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means of delivering the Church;</hi> and for that Reaſon I am charitably inclin'd to think, that the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44281:36"/>
this Doctrine ſhould extend beyond <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Tolerable</hi> Evils; for ſtretching it to <hi>Intolerable</hi> and <hi>Univerſal</hi> Miſchiefs, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd 'em void of <hi>Sence</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> as well as <hi>Humanity,</hi> which can no way agree with ſome of their Characters.</p>
            <p>Sober Men would ſoon be agreed about the Reſiſtance pleaded for, if they were not more prejudic'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Word,</hi> than againſt what is intended in the <hi>Thing,</hi> either as to the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of it; for to reſiſt <hi>Violent Uſurpations,</hi> and <hi>Horrid Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties,</hi> is not Reſiſting the <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> or the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, but oppoſing <hi>Murderers,</hi> and <hi>Cut-Throats,</hi> who under Venerable <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes</hi> are Deſtroying the People, and covering the Land with <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Carnage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Names and Titles can never <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> or Alter the Nature of <hi>Facts,</hi> the thing <hi>done,</hi> and the Manner and End of doing it will <hi>denominate</hi> the Action: For tho as <hi>King</hi> he may put his Subjects to Death by <hi>form</hi> of Law, he cannot <hi>kill</hi> or otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them without it, but at the

            <p>The <hi>Ends</hi> of Government (which is the <hi>Peoples Good</hi>) are as <hi>Sacred</hi> as the <hi>Prince's Authority;</hi> and if, as the Apoſtle ſays, he be not to us the <hi>Miniſter of God for Good,</hi> he looſes the Title of <hi>God's Miniſter,</hi> for <hi>his Servants they are whom they obey.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> never Intended to Abrogate the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> which gives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Individual Perſon a <hi>Right</hi> to his <hi>Own,</hi> nor Expoſe Men to <hi>Beggary, Slavery, Inevitable Ruine here, and Damnation hereafter;</hi> for Reſiſting a <hi>Prince</hi> that was ingaged to <hi>deſtroy</hi> his <hi>People;</hi> ſince no Man that has not loſt the uſe of his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> can believe that <hi>Murdering, Ruining, and Inſlaving the Bodies and Souls of the People,</hi> is any part of <hi>Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or that <hi>Reſiſting</hi> an <hi>Implacable Tyrant,</hi> is Reſiſting the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> when 'tis plain that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave him any <hi>ſuch</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:44281:37"/>To ſay that ſuch Kings are ſet up by the Almighty, as a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for our Sins, is no Argument againſt <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> but a ſtrong one for it; for the <hi>Peſtilence, Famine,</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> of Foreign Enemies, are all of them Evils <hi>ſent</hi> by God for the puniſhment of our Offences; yet I think no Man will ſay but we ought by all <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Humane Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> to free our ſelves from thoſe Calamities, without an immediate Revelation. The like may be ſaid of Tyrants; for the contrary would level us with <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which may be <hi>Sold, Kill'd</hi> and <hi>Devour'd,</hi> at the Will of thoſe that have power over them.

            <p>No King in <hi>Europe</hi> has more his <hi>own Will,</hi> and lives more <hi>happily,</hi> than He which conforms his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Actions to the Senſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and in this Senſe he may be as <hi>Abſolute</hi> as he pleaſes, without O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning the World to accompliſh it: He can <hi>Deſire</hi> nothing, but what will be <hi>freely</hi> Granted him; nor <hi>Do</hi> any thing, that will be Diſtaſted. And what can the <hi>greateſt Monarch</hi> in the World deſire more, than to have his Wants <hi>Liberally</hi> Supply'd, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <hi>Univerſally</hi> Approv'd, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded? This, and no other End, is the Deſign of the Reſiſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, but that a Prince, <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided</hi> by ill Counſel, may, without Injury to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> or Diminution to his <hi>Rightful</hi> Authority, (if fair Means can prevail,) be Reclaim'd from Violating the Rights of his Subjects, and brought to a Temper conſiſtent with his <hi>Own,</hi> and his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> Happineſs: And if any Ill-minded Men carry it further, we can only ſay, that the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44281:38"/>
Thing, does not impeach the <hi>Lawful</hi> Uſe of it: Let thoſe that <hi>offend</hi> the Law, ſuffer for the <hi>Breach</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Another End of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> is, the Good of the People; for when all other Means to reduce the Prince into a right Temper, has, with all due Reſpect, and Submiſſion, been us'd, but effected nothing; then, and not before, Reſiſtance is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for our Privileges are granted by the <hi>ſame</hi> Laws, by which the Prince has <hi>his</hi> Authority; and makes an <hi>Univerſal</hi> Defection, or Reſiſtance, lawful, when all would be Ruin'd without it; for the Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> is not of Conſtant and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Obligation, in all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Calling to Account, are Acts of Authority; but Reſiſtance for <hi>Self-Defence,</hi> is a Right of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Inalienable. In every Province and Kingdom of the Univerſe, we may find Inſtances where Subjects have been neceſſitated to ſecure <hi>Themſelves,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi> by Reſiſting their Prince, whoſe repeated <hi>Acts of Tyranny</hi> did viſibly threaten their <hi>Ruin;</hi> and this was always look'd upon as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

Reaſon to diſpence with their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> eſpecially when the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity was not <hi>pretended,</hi> or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by themſelves; but apparently forc'd on them by their Prince, who was oblig'd to preſerve them. When our <hi>Saviour</hi> was walking in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and expected the <hi>Jews</hi> to come and Seize him by Violence, he was pleas'd to command, <hi>that he which had a Sword, ſhould take it;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told there were <hi>Two Swords,</hi> he ſaid, it was <hi>Enough.</hi> How Enough? Not to encounter the <hi>Arm'd</hi> Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that came along with <hi>Judas!</hi> he could not think ſo!

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:44281:41"/>
they are not to blame; for they did not Deſert or Reſiſt him, till he had <hi>Renounc'd</hi> to be their <hi>King</hi> according to the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> by avowing to Govern by a <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Conſtitution, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p>The Breach was firſt made on his part, by <hi>Renouncing</hi> to be their <hi>King</hi> according to the <hi>Law</hi> that made him <hi>King;</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch a King as he Swore to be at his Coronation; ſuch a King, to whom the Obedience, and Allegiance; of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Subjects are due;</hi> and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a <hi>Dominion,</hi> which, to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Purpoſes, was as manifeſt an <hi>Abdication,</hi> or <hi>Abandoning</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, as if had done it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words, or Formal Deed.

the Kingdom, could have prevail'd with him to have done himſelf, and his Subjects, Juſtice, the <hi>Crown</hi> had been ſtill upon his Head, and his Subjects <hi>happy</hi> under him: But he poſitively refus'd all Advices, but what tended to his Ruin; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his good Subjects <hi>Prayers,</hi> the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, the <hi>Love</hi> he ought to have born to his own Country, now on the Brink of Deſtruction, nor his own <hi>Intereſt,</hi> could influence him to Act Reaſonably, or ſee his own Ruin, before an <hi>Obſtinate</hi> Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had render'd it deſperate!

ſuffer the <hi>Fate</hi> of a whole Kingdom, to depend upon a Senſleſs and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious <hi>Peradventure:</hi> All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly conſider'd, nothing in the World will appear more Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Juſt, and Neceſſary, than our <hi>Self-Defence,</hi> againſt the Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>James</hi> the Second, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our ſelves without his Concurrence; it being not in the Deſign of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> or in the Power of <hi>Art,</hi> to make that Man happy, who, inſtead of Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, Acts directly againſt it: And therefore, his Intereſt was not ſo conſiderable, as to be preferr'd before the Safety of the Kingdom, and the Lives and Fortunes of his <hi>Quondam</hi> Subjects, which were ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Brands</hi> out of the <hi>Fire,</hi> by the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſting</hi> in our <hi>Own</hi> Defence.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Promoters of <hi>Slavery,</hi> under the Umbrage of Non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance fall very heavy upon this <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> Principle, and upbraid the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as oppoſite to the Law of <hi>God,</hi> to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to the Laws of our own <hi>Land;</hi> but a brief diſcuſſion of their ſuggeſtions, will
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44281:42"/>
ſhew their <hi>Lyon</hi> is not ſo fierce as they have painted him. The Holy Scripture does command Obedience to Authority without <hi>Exceptions,</hi> and forbids <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of the Supreme Power under ſevere <hi>Penalties;</hi> but it ſeems very hard that Religion ſhould weaken our Arm in defence of it ſelf, and force our Obedience to a Power ſet up to Ruin it; and therefore unleſs our Adverſaries can prove this <hi>General</hi> prohibition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Deſign of the <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> to all caſes of <hi>Apparent,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Neceſſity,</hi> ſuch as ours was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the late Reign (which I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd they cannot do) they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>purpoſe;</hi> for we urge it no farther, and equally abhor it when it <hi>exceeds</hi> thoſe Caſes as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with Chriſtianity; but yet we ſay alſo that Non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not always obliging, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs may be circumſtantiated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>General</hi> Precepts, or Prohibitions, are always to be underſtood with <hi>particular</hi> exceptions to unforeſeen accidents, and makes what was <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> at ſome time, and in ſome caſes, become our <hi>Duty</hi> in others.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44281:43"/>
Therefore Men muſt not run into a <hi>Triumph</hi> when a Text or two, ſeems to favour their opinion; for as an <hi>Ingenious</hi> Author obſerves, <hi>Eternal Righteouſneſs, Juſtice and Truth, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Honeſty, the Right of the Caſe, and the Reaſon of the thing,</hi> muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways govern the ſenſe of Scriptural expreſſions. <hi>Saul</hi> was an Anointed <hi>King,</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> had commiſſion from God Almighty to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him when he tranſgreſſed the bounds that God had ſet him. And it may be ſhew'd in many Inſtances, (tho' ſcarce parallel with our <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> circumſtances under the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Second,) where Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was not only allow'd but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. The Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who muſt be preſum'd to know the Law of God <hi>better</hi> than others, and <hi>were fill'd with the Spirit of God,</hi> in all their Actions incourag'd the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to riſe in <hi>Arms</hi> againſt their <hi>Princes</hi> who kept them in continual bondage, and ſlavery, and the Names of <hi>Deborah, Barach, Gideon, Abimelec, Jeptha, Samſon, &amp;c.</hi> are celebrated upon the ſame occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44281:43"/>Nor is the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> againſt Reſiſtance in caſes of <hi>Extream Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> and I wonder how any Man can urge the <hi>contrary,</hi> ſince it both Aſſerts and Approves it. The Law of <hi>Nature</hi> ſays the incomparable <hi>Grotius</hi> is a Judgment or Inſtinct of <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> which Judges by the conformity and contrariety of an Action with <hi>Reaſonable Nature,</hi> what there is in every action of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>turpitude,</hi> or moral <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and how far it is commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Author</hi> of Nature. Now <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> tells us it is Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend our <hi>Lives</hi> againſt the Attempts of every <hi>unlawful</hi> Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. And Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſuſpected to give too little power to <hi>Kings,</hi> or too much to the <hi>People,</hi> ſays 'tis the <hi>Firſt</hi> principle of <hi>Natural</hi> Right, for every Man to defend his <hi>Life</hi> and his <hi>Limbs,</hi> by all means that he poſſibly can; for tho' when Communities and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are <hi>form'd,</hi> this <hi>Right</hi> of Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Avenging our ſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves upon the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and conſequently makes it unlawful for us to kill a Man that

endeavours to <hi>Aſſaſſinate</hi> us, if we can prevent his <hi>efforts</hi> by addreſſing our ſelves to <hi>Juſtice;</hi> yet if by that means we cannot ſecure our lives, <hi>that Neceſſity</hi> puts us in poſſeſſion of our <hi>Natural Right,</hi> and our own <hi>Arm</hi> becomes our Magiſtrate, and gives us Authority to defend our own lives, tho' (if it cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) with the loſs of the Aggreſſors. Let us put the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Prince had <hi>reſolv'd</hi> on a deſign to <hi>Kill</hi> his Subjects, that he ſolemnly ſwore to protect; what are the Subjects to do in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; To ſay they will implore the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Laws</hi> was to <hi>mock</hi> them, and <hi>delude</hi> our ſelves, for they cannot reſiſt <hi>Dragoons</hi> and <hi>Fire-Locks.</hi> To go to the <hi>King</hi> is to no purpoſe; he is in the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and ſo far engaged, that he thinks in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> he cannot go back, and is therefore ſtocking himſelf with a ſett of Men, that will not <hi>boggle</hi> at the execution of it. In ſuch a Caſe this <hi>Abſolute Neceſſity</hi> (where the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt periſh for want of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) puts us in poſſeſſion of our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right</hi> to defend our ſelves; for

none has a <hi>power</hi> in <hi>Right</hi> of his own <hi>Will</hi> to take away our <hi>Lives,</hi> but the Almighty power that <hi>gave</hi> them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> command, and commend a dutiful ſubmiſſion to Authority; but neither <hi>Reaſon, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> obliges us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>Creator,</hi> or ſubſcribe to ſuch orders of an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> Prince, as manifeſtly oppoſe the <hi>Rights</hi> of God, unleſs we are fond of Inheriting the Title of being <hi>Cruel</hi> to our <hi>ſelves, Unnatural</hi> to our <hi>Children,</hi> and profeſs'd <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Country,</hi> for tho' ſlavery may be

            <p>Another great Engine wherewith our Adverſaries ſerve themſelves to batter down the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> is the Law of the <hi>Land,</hi> and particularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> made in the 13th of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, which ſeems in their apprehenſions, to extirpate this Principal <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch;</hi> tho' I believe 'twill fail them, when we have conſider'd the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of that Law, and the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Ligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators.

            <p>Their <hi>Religion</hi> was never in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by any of thoſe Kings: But ours had receiv'd a deadly Wound by <hi>James</hi> the Second, and was almoſt <hi>Expiring,</hi> till we took ſhelter under a <hi>Prince</hi> who is not only able to Protect his <hi>own</hi> Subjects, but to <hi>hinder</hi> other Nations from being brought under the Yoke of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>The Reader (I hope) will eaſily perceive that theſe Inſtances are not urg'd to flatter the <hi>Rage,</hi> or gratifie the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of Seditious <hi>Rebels;</hi> but only to ſhew, that it has always been the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under all <hi>Forms</hi> of Religion, to be very <hi>Tender</hi> of their <hi>Privileges;</hi> and gave greater Proofs of their Zeal for them in Times of <hi>Popery,</hi> than ever they have done ſince ehe <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> obtain'd amongſt us: Which may, at once, confute the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> and convince the <hi>World,</hi> that we did not reſiſt the late King <hi>James</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but becauſe he was a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> tho' it has been

obſerv'd in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> was the firſt Step to <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and the nearer any of our <hi>Kings</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Popery, ſo much the more did our Privileges <hi>decline,</hi> till at laſt they were almoſt totally deſtroy'd by a <hi>Prince</hi> that openly profeſs'd it; and all our Crime is, that we would not be content to be Ruin'd by the late <hi>King,</hi> and his Popiſh Emmiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and rather choſe to deſire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Liberty, and the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Privileges, from His <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty,</hi> than abide in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the vileſt Slaves to the late King <hi>James!</hi> A Crime, for which, I am very confident, no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> tho' he Rail at us with his <hi>Tongue,</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us in his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And this brings us to the laſt Plea that our Opponents are pleas'd to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> and ſecuring our Obedience to the late King; <hi>viz.

               <hi>Annulling</hi> and <hi>Diſabling</hi> Laws. And to ſhew all the World his <hi>Arbitrary Ends,</hi> he gave ſuch a Specimen of his Single, <hi>Unlimited</hi> Power there, that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do more in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (which, as well as ours, is a Limited Monarchy,) than the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power of <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> together, were able to do; and that was, by impoſing an <hi>Oath</hi> on that People, contrary to Law, in theſe Words:</p>

            <p>And this, I take Leave to ſay, the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Subject; becauſe it was, in it ſelf, a <hi>Subverſion</hi> of the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> as being an Obligation to ſupport a <hi>Power</hi> deſtructive to the whole Frame of the Government. This <hi>Caprichio</hi> of the late King <hi>James</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:44281:59"/>
was the Maſter-piece of all his <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited</hi> Counſels, and the Finiſhing Stroke of an Eternal Vaſſalage; for this Oath was created by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, and his Arbitrary Power was to be ſupported by this Oath; and both muſt grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and run in an Endleſs Circle, to the utter <hi>Extinction</hi> of all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> of our Natural <hi>Liberty,</hi> or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>Government.</hi> And what was done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in its Courſe, muſt have been exercis'd in <hi>England</hi> alſo; the late <hi>King</hi> having no more, or other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in one Kingdom, than he has in the other; and both then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the ſame <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Miniſters.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the late King aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Diſpenſing power,</hi> Uſurp'd the whole <hi>Legiſlative Authority</hi> into his own Hands, for to <hi>Diſpenſe</hi> with Laws is as great a power as to make them; and by the exerciſe of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted himſelf with a power as great, if not greater, than that of <hi>King and Parliament</hi> together, who can joyntly, but not ſeverally, give any Reſolve the Authority of a Law.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44281:60"/>
The pretences to juſtifie this Action was, that he might have the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all his Subjects, and that the Papiſts having been equally Loyal to his Progenitors, they might not be diſcourag'd by <hi>legal</hi> Diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. This was but a light pretence, tho' part of the Intrigue, for his diſpencing power was chiefly directed to another and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign, the Preſs was loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and City and Country fill'd with invectives againſt <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as unneceſſary <hi>Wenns</hi> in the Government that were fit to be cut off, that the Royal Authority might be without any Legal, or Pecuniary Reſtraint, or Limitation. Now the <hi>Diſpencing Power</hi> would do this Work effectually; for it put the whole <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Authority into the <hi>King</hi>'s Hands, and made Parliaments <hi>Uſeleſs,</hi> and ſignifie <hi>Nothing!</hi> For <hi>this End</hi> was it ſet up: And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that were <hi>Unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd</hi> by Law, was for no other End, but to ſupport the <hi>Diſpencing</hi> Power, till it had accompliſh'd what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it.</p>

neceſſary, as impos'd on him by his Conſcience; evident in all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; Univerſal in its Object, and Extent; Conſummated in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; Eternal in its Conſequence; and altogether incurable by reaſon of his Age, and introducing a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir; without the Application of ſuch a <hi>Speedy</hi> and <hi>Effectual</hi> Remedy as <hi>God</hi> was pleas'd to ſend us in our Extremity.</p>
            <p>Some of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends are pleas'd to extenuate the Crimes they cannot defend, in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all the <hi>Faults</hi> of his Reign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Miniſters;</hi> which, if allow'd to be <hi>True,</hi> might leſſen them in part, but not diſcharge him of the whole: For if the <hi>Maſter's</hi> Actions be never ſo Innocent, or Inoffenſive; yet, if out of Cowardice, or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he becomes the <hi>Patron</hi> of his <hi>Servants</hi> Inſolencies and Outrages, by <hi>Protecting,</hi> or not <hi>Puniſhing</hi> their Miſdemeanours, he renders himſelf Guilty, and will ſhare in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Hatred of his People.

Men,</hi> and others, to engage with him in his Deſign of Setting up <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Diſpencing</hi> with Laws, and whoſe Image and Superſcription it bears, the Glory of the Enterprize will be all his own; for I can never think his <hi>Miniſters</hi> capable of all thoſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies</hi> themſelves, any further than that they knew it would pleaſe him. Indeed, I can very eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them chiefly Devoted to their <hi>Own</hi> Intereſts, and willing to <hi>Share</hi> in the Spoil of Ruin'd Subjects; yet methinks there ſhould be ſome <hi>kind</hi> Remembrance of their <hi>Native</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that would ſometimes check the Diſſoluteneſs of ſuch <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements: And a certain <hi>Pride</hi> that Men take in acting <hi>prudently,</hi> and not expoſing themſelves to the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> and <hi>Deriſion</hi> of all Mankind, ſhould have ſtopp'd their Carier in ſuch <hi>Illegal</hi> Proceedings. And ſo it appear'd; for at laſt, under theſe Apprehenſions, we find many that deſerted the late King, after he thought himſelf ſure of them; and reſign'd their Places, and refus'd to act by his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> or obey his <hi>Orders,</hi> after their Names were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

in Commiſſions, and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Actually</hi> Engag'd in his Service.

            <p>Something might be ſaid in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the late <hi>King,</hi> if he had ſet up his <hi>Diſpencing</hi> Power for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good; but 'tis evidemt that it was only intended to enable <hi>Papiſts</hi> to ruin <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Iriſh Parliament,</hi> in their Act of <hi>Attainder,</hi> put it out of their <hi>King</hi>'s Power to exerciſe his <hi>Prerogative</hi> in ſhewing Kindneſs to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that wanted it: For when<note n="*" place="margin">See The State of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Biſhop <hi>King, p. 179.</hi>

            <p>From this, and other Inſtances that might be given, we may ſee their <hi>Popiſh Juggling;</hi> for when an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> is made againſt a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> 'twas no leſs than <hi>Treaſon</hi> to queſtion the King's <hi>Pardoning</hi> and <hi>Diſpencing Power;</hi> but when an <hi>Act</hi> bears hard on a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and their <hi>King</hi> (as he pretends) has a Mind to <hi>Eaſe</hi> them, then the <hi>King</hi> has no <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Diſpence,</hi> he <hi>cannot</hi> grant a <hi>Pardon,</hi> his Hands are bound up by <hi>Law.</hi> So that the End of Setting up this <hi>Diſpencing Power,</hi> was only to ſhelter <hi>Papiſts</hi> from the Law, and ruin <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in their Hearts, we ſee, are as much againſt it, as the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> To go on:</p>
            <p>The late King declar'd in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that he would publiſh ſuch a <hi>Proclamation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as he had

done in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that none ſhould have Employments under him, that would not co-operate in taking off the Penal Laws: And he began to execute theſe Reſolutions with a Conduct full of <hi>Violence,</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was put out of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and Suſpended from his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Office, becauſe he would not Suſpend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> now Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> without Legal Proceſs. The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was depriv'd of his Office of <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> becauſe he would not <hi>change</hi> his Religion. And the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> loſt his Office, becauſe he would not <hi>violate</hi> the Laws of the Kingdom, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Honours</hi> at the Reception of the <hi>Pope's Nuncio,</hi> as is uſual at the Introduction of Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>To ſay, in Excuſe of this, that <hi>James</hi> the Second turn'd out Great Officers of <hi>State,</hi> becauſe they would not obey him, and concurr with his Intenſions, is to publiſh a <hi>Truth</hi> that ought to have been <hi>Conceal'd</hi> by his own Party; becauſe it was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonſtration, that his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

were <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> and level'd againſt our <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> In Things <hi>Lawful,</hi> tho' not <hi>Expedient,</hi> he found a <hi>Tacit</hi> Compliance; nay, ſome of them, to keep him in <hi>Temper,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps comply'd further with him than the Strictneſs of the Law would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; (as Men pull down ſome Houſes at a <hi>Fire,</hi> to preſerve the whole Town from Burning:) But, to comply in all things, had been to forfeit their own <hi>Honours,</hi> to juſtifie his Illegalities, and <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Means that the late King <hi>James</hi> employ'd, for the Deſtruction of the Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>England,</hi> was, granting an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion,</hi> directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law. This declar'd by what Methods he intended to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; for every Step he made, was a <hi>new Project</hi> to aſſert his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power; and acquaint his Subjects, that he would make all Laws <hi>Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> that all Power ſhould reſt in his <hi>own</hi> Hands, and the Adminiſtration be Iſſu'd from no other Source but his own Will and Pleaſure; for there was no Occaſion for ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but only to ſhew what he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44281:69"/>
would be at, and declare his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ruin the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> were <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voto's</hi> of the <hi>Court;</hi> for the <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>'s Name was put in, but to <hi>grace</hi> the Matter: They knew before that he would not Act; and therefore, to colour the <hi>Sham,</hi> they oblig'd him to ask Leave to be abſent.</p>
            <p>To make this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> more Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, a <hi>Papiſt</hi> is appointed one of the <hi>Commiſſioners;</hi> and the whole cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as <hi>Abſolute</hi> a Power, as the late King himſelf was aſpiring after!

               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:44281:70"/>

            <p>The modeſteſt Terms the <hi>Popiſh Writers</hi> can afford the <hi>Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> is, That they are a Pack of <hi>Sacrilegious Uſurpers</hi> of their Church's Patrimony, and a Neſt of <hi>Obſtinate Hereticks</hi> that ought to be <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> to their Revenge, and <hi>Rooted</hi> out of the World by any Means whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and this, ſay they, is always to be attempted by every <hi>good Prince,</hi> according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Salvo, <hi>Ne ſint fortiores nobis; Unleſs they be too

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Popery</hi> is againſt <hi>the Laws of Society</hi> in all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Countries, as well as in <hi>England;</hi> for, according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tradition, the <hi>Reform'd</hi> are all <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and, as ſuch, are <hi>Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Facto</hi> depriv'd of the <hi>Right</hi> they had to their <hi>Goods,</hi> their <hi>Children,</hi>

his own <hi>Religion</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of his Government.</p>
            <p>'Tis a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to believe he will act againſt his own <hi>Inclination,</hi> or that he will cancel the <hi>Antecedent</hi> Obligation which he was under to the Church his Mother, in <hi>preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hereticks,</hi> that are not a People, but a looſe ſort of Animals, doom'd to Deſtruction!

            <p>There are many Conſiderations that juſtify the <hi>Interpoſition</hi> of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the firſt is, That 'twas to preſerve the Peace of <hi>Europe;</hi> for all their Neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> perceiving the growing <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to threaten the Welfare and Quiet of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and that the <hi>Obſequious</hi> compliance of the late King <hi>James,</hi> in all the Proceedings of that Towering <hi>Monarch</hi> (as well as <hi>Monſieur le Comte d'Avaux's Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi>) ſhew'd a dangerous <hi>Allyance</hi> between thoſe <hi>Two</hi> Crowns; the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> enter'd into a Confederacy to prevent the Conjunction of the <hi>Armies</hi> of theſe two Princes, and ſave <hi>Europe.</hi> This memorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence happening about the ſame time that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had promis'd to Aſſiſt the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in Redreſſing their <hi>Grievances,</hi>

and Reſtoring them to their <hi>Juſt</hi> Rights and Privileges.

thoſe of common <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is given by themſelves; as I find it in an Extract of the Reſolutions of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> upon the 28th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1688. where, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons, for Aſſiſting the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with a <hi>Fleet</hi> and an <hi>Army,</hi> this is one. <hi>The King of</hi> France (ſay they) <hi>hath, upon ſeveral Occaſions, ſhew'd himſelf diſaffected to that State, which gave Cauſe to fear, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that in caſe the King of</hi> Great Britain <hi>ſhould happen to obtain an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power over his People; that then both Kings out of Intereſt of State, and Hatred, and Zeal, againſt the Proteſtant Religion, would endeavour to bring that State to confuſion, and, if poſſible, quite ſubject it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no queſtion, but this <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Prudent</hi> State ſaw our <hi>Ruine,</hi> would, in time, prove their own alſo, and <hi>Foreſeeing</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi> it, will Juſtify them before God and all the World.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44281:81"/>
of <hi>Europe:</hi> Let us take a ſhort view how theſe Princes carried it one towards the other.</p>
            <p>None are Ignorant that the F.

            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:44281:82"/>At the very beginning of the late King's Reign, the F. K. ſet him a Pattern at home, and broke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Ed.</hi> Nants, 1685.</note> and King <hi>James,</hi> in imitation of ſo pious an Example, ſet up his diſpencing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>England,</hi> violated his Oaths and Promiſes to his People, and both under pretence of Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but all the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes were ſenſible to what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers that boaſted Zeal had reduc'd them to; for what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, what Veneration could they think thoſe Princes had for the Name of Chriſtian, that made no Conſcience of their Oaths, that broke their Faith with Chriſtians, and leagu'd with Infidels; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Creſcent of <hi>Mahomet</hi> before the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and brib'd the <hi>Turks</hi> to begin a War againſt the Emperor<note n="*" place="margin">1683.</note> and Ruin that Capital City <hi>Vienna,</hi> which is the Bulwork of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt the Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>

            <p>As this affected Devotion of the <hi>F—</hi> K. was ſubſervient to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo <hi>James</hi> IId's Biggotry was early ſuſpected to riſe from the ſame Cauſe, as the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd before King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in a Speech<note n="*" place="margin">Shaftsbury's <hi>Speech.

               <hi>were Better, and Fairer, than he could, or did expect from him:</hi> But all this, on the late King's part, was only a <hi>Flouriſh,</hi> a Touch of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> Morals; for the late King <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> intended to perform one Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theſe <hi>Specious</hi> Pretences; and therefore, having ſent away the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Child,</hi> Count <hi>Dada,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuntio,</hi> Father <hi>Petre,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> to be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Thames,</hi> he only ſhew'd this Complaiſance, to <hi>Gain Time</hi> for his own Departure into <hi>France</hi> after them.</p>
            <p>What a fair Opportunity was now, at the very laſt, put into the late <hi>King</hi>'s Hands, to have Redeem'd his <hi>Honour, Settl'd</hi> the Nation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all ill Conſequences to his Perſon, and Affairs, if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd his own propos'd Methods for an <hi>Accommodation,</hi> and kept his <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> Promiſes; but he would not.

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:44281:93"/>What <hi>Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of his own <hi>Will,</hi> has Decreed, can never be <hi>Revok'd;</hi> and that for the Accompliſhing God's <hi>Divine</hi> Pleaſure, Men act directly contrary to their own <hi>Intereſts,</hi> which has been notorious in the <hi>whole</hi> Conduct of this Unhappy <hi>Prince,</hi> and has been Jocoſely obſerv'd by others.</p>
            <p>I remember to have ſeen a <hi>Letter</hi> written into <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> Commander there, giving an Account of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Management of his Affairs in that Kingdom, wherein he expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after this manner, <hi>That if</hi> (the late) <hi>King</hi> James <hi>had as many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to loſe as are number'd in</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>his own Conduct would forfeit them all; for if he had Twenty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and Nineteen of them were Men of approv'd Wiſdom, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grety, and but one Fool, and ſenſleſs Perſon among them, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the advice of that blind</hi> Bayard, <hi>in oppoſition to all the other Sages.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Without reflecting upon his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> the late <hi>King</hi> confirm'd the <hi>French Gentleman</hi>'s Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

in purſuing the Falſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive <hi>Opinions</hi> of thoſe that advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to withdraw himſelf, againſt the wholeſome Counſels of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men, that advis'd Calling of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> in order to his own, and the Nation's future Happineſs; and made it appear a Project ſo weak, and ſilly, that there ſeems ſomething of a Divine Infatuation in it.</p>
            <p>But he had promis'd the <hi>Queen,</hi> and, as ſome ſay, taken the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon it, to follow her; and thought fit rather to break his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with a whole Nation, than not humour a <hi>pettiſh</hi> Woman: <hi>Go he muſt, go he will, let whatever will be the Conſequence of it:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to do all the <hi>Miſchief</hi> he could before he went, and leave the <hi>Realm</hi> in all the <hi>Confuſion</hi> was poſſible;</p>
            <p>He Order'd all thoſe <hi>Writs</hi> for the Sitting of a <hi>Parliament</hi> that were not ſent out, to be <hi>burnt,</hi> and a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat</hi> to be Enter'd againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of thoſe that were ſent out; and about the ſame time ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Army, and Diſmiſs the

            <p>How could the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have done their <hi>King</hi> a greater Injury, than in perſuading him to a continual Breach of his Promiſes, which expos'd his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> to common Cenſure, and drew the Contempt of the whole Nation upon him, as <hi>a Prince never to be truſted!</hi> At his firſt Acceſſion to the <hi>Throne,</hi> one of the Things his <hi>Favourites</hi> magnify'd him for, was, for being <hi>True</hi> to his Word; but he reſolv'd to <hi>prove</hi> the contrary, and break it in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>He <hi>promis'd</hi> to protect the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and maintain the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Religion, when his whole <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> was to deſtroy both, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd it in every, <hi>Action!</hi> He <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> to Govern by <hi>Law,</hi> and not <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily;</hi> and at the ſame time was Inveſting himſelf, and his Miniſters, with a <hi>Power</hi> to deſtroy them!

            <p>Of theſe Riddles, and Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, we had continual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience from his <hi>Creatures</hi> alſo; who, when they were under any <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſerving themſelves by the <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> flap'd us in the Mouth with their King's <hi>Juſtneſs</hi> to his <hi>Word;</hi> but when the <hi>Fiſh</hi> was caught, threw away the <hi>Net,</hi> and left the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to repent their Eaſineſs at leiſure. So that Doctor <hi>Cartwright</hi> had the only true Notion of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King's <hi>Promiſes,</hi> when in a <hi>Sermon</hi> Preach'd at his Deanary of <hi>Rippon,</hi> he told his Auditors, <hi>that the late King's Promiſes were Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ought not to be too ſtrictly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44281:95"/>
examin'd, or charg'd upon him; but that we muſt leave His Majeſty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his own Meaning:</hi> For which, and other <hi>like</hi> Services, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the Biſhoprick of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi> And the late King did the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor the <hi>Honour</hi> to Copy his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſuffer'd neither <hi>Truth, Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Sincerity,</hi> to accompany any of his <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to his good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p>Nay, if the late King would at any time have kept his Word, he could not; for by putting himſelf under the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he made it as impoſſible for him to keep his Faith with <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> as it was for <hi>Sygiſmond</hi> the Emperor to prevent the Burning of <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> (to whom he had granted Safe Conduct,) when the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had a Mind to Sacrifice him, as a Contumacious Heretick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delays</hi> being dangerous, and the late King's <hi>Tricking</hi> evident, His Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> by the Advice and Conſent of the <hi>Body</hi> of the Nation, took up a Reſolution of ſending out his <hi>Circular Letters</hi> to

But the <hi>Lords</hi> at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> hearing that <hi>Whitehall</hi> was again <hi>crouded</hi> with <hi>Iriſh-men, Prieſts, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> did not think it Reaſonable the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould accept the late King's <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and venture his <hi>Perſon</hi> near a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44281:97"/>
Place <hi>haunted</hi> with ſuch <hi>Bloody-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>Profligate</hi> Wretches, till the <hi>Prince</hi>'s own <hi>Guards</hi> had taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Poſts</hi> about <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to prevent that Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Removing</hi> and placing the <hi>Guards,</hi> made it late before the <hi>Lords</hi> could deliver the Meſſage they brought from <hi>Windſor,</hi> viz. <hi>That the late King would Remove to</hi> Ham: Which, at his own Deſire, and I ſuppoſe to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Purpoſe of going into <hi>France,</hi> (tho' that was a Secret unknown to others,) was chang'd to <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> There the late King continu'd a while; but reſolving to be <hi>Nothing,</hi> unleſs he might be <hi>Abſolute;</hi> like Children that have loſt their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Play-thing,</hi> throw away all the reſt in a Fit of Pettiſhneſs; ſo he went into <hi>France,</hi> left <hi>England</hi> very abruptly, and the <hi>Convention</hi> took that Opportunity of parting with him <hi>Fairly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>James</hi> the Second <hi>Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the Government by other <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> Actions, as well as his Flight, yielded his vacant Throne to the <hi>Pr.</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> and if His Highneſs had <hi>Aſcended</hi> it without any other <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:44281:98"/>
as ſome <hi>Kings</hi> of this Nation have done <hi>before</hi> him on the like Occaſion, none could have blam'd him for making uſe of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his <hi>Sword</hi> had gain'd him; But as he came to Redreſs the <hi>Grievances</hi> of the Nation, by <hi>Calling a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> ſo he would abide by their <hi>Determination</hi> in what concern'd his own Perſon, and not by any <hi>Raſh</hi> or <hi>Precipitate</hi> Action, ſeem to croſs the <hi>End</hi> of his Coming, which was to have all Things <hi>ſettl'd</hi> according to <hi>Law;</hi> and therefore he left that, and all other our Affairs, to be ſettl'd by the approaching <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The late <hi>King</hi> was under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by virtue of the <hi>Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> between the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>(which Compact is Imbody'd in our Conſtitution, Imply'd in our Laws, and Runs through all our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,)</hi> his Coronation-Oath, and the Truſt repos'd in him by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to govern according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Laws, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready largely prov'd: But on the contrary, he broke <hi>all</hi> the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Laws,</hi> fell foul upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Conſtitution it ſelf, and gave <hi>no</hi> Quarter to any thing that oppos'd his <hi>Arbitrary Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And was not this a publick <hi>Declaration</hi> that he would not be kept within the Bounds of Law, nor hold his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> upon thoſe Terms?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Original Contract</hi> made him a <hi>Legal</hi> King; but if he might not act the part of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> he would be nothing at all.

            </p>

            <p>Now, ſince 'tis viſible that the late King <hi>James</hi> was fled, and that it was abſolutely neceſſary the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be ſupply'd, and ſome other <hi>King</hi> plac'd in the <hi>Throne,</hi> who accepting the Crown upon the Conditions tender'd with it, would give Aſſurance of Governing by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Conſtitution, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Happineſs under him, there can remain no reaſonable Objection againſt his Title. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
            <p>His Sacred Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> the Third, in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is God's <hi>King,</hi> as being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Providence, (by whom Kings Reign,) aſſiſted by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, and the Glorious Inſtrument in his Hand, to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and Accompliſh ſuch a <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> as in common Gratitude, without Reſpect to other <hi>Right,</hi> in all Nations of the World has been conſtantly <hi>Rewarded</hi> with a Crown; and more particularly in <hi>England,</hi> upon that Reſpect <hi>Alone,</hi> has juſtly meritted the Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:44281:138"/>His preſent Majeſty is alſo God's <hi>King,</hi> as being the Wiſe and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Champion of all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches in <hi>Europe;</hi> and who with his Sword, his Head, and Heart, fights for Chriſt's Religion, and to reſcue the Profeſſors of it from mighty Combinations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them Root and Branch.

               <hi>Recognition</hi> of their Rights: But <hi>King William</hi> the Third's Right is not only <hi>Recogniz'd</hi> by a <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> but his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> is Guarded by an <hi>Act of Aſſotiation,</hi> wherein all his Subjects have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd themſelves to <hi>Defend</hi> him with their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> the Injury of his Perſon upon all the <hi>Agreſſors.</hi> And what could be more done to declare his <hi>Right,</hi> and engage our <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>Rarity</hi> of theſe Things happening, and a general <hi>Ignorance</hi> in the Hiſtory of Precedent Times, that makes ſuch Proceedings ſeem ſtrange and unaccountable to thoſe who have been <hi>Nurs'd</hi> up in <hi>Slaviſh</hi> Notions, and apprehend not the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of thoſe Overtures againſt <hi>King James</hi> the Second, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Throne by the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>William</hi> the Third. For,</p>
            <p>Our preſent <hi>King William</hi> came into as <hi>Empty</hi> a Throne as the late <hi>King James</hi> himſelf did; a <hi>Civil</hi> Death in the Eye of the Law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as effectual a <hi>Vacancy</hi> as a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Death; and therefore <hi>King William</hi> had the ſame <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture,</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:44281:139"/>
as if his <hi>Abdicated</hi> Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had left the World, as well as his <hi>Native</hi> Country. Why then ſhould Men create themſelves <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>diſquiet</hi> their own and other Men's <hi>Conſciences,</hi> by Vexatious Diſputes againſt the <hi>Divine</hi> Will, <hi>Poſitive</hi> Laws, and the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of a whole Nation. <hi>Solomon</hi> was not <hi>David</hi>'s Heir, and yet he Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and was Obey'd with good Conſcience. <hi>Joram</hi> was <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Son, but <hi>Jehu</hi> ſucceeded King: <hi>Joram</hi> had a Right from <hi>Ahab,</hi> but <hi>Jehu</hi> from God. <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> had Right by Deſcent from <hi>Saul,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> was made King: And 'twas for the ſake of Religion that they were thus Plac'd, and Diſplac'd. In <hi>France, Childeric</hi> was Depos'd, and <hi>Egidius,</hi> or <hi>Gillon,</hi> a mere Stranger, (but in Reputation for <hi>Probity</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi>) was Elected in his ſtead. <hi>Pepin</hi> was Elected King, and <hi>Thierry</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. <hi>Pepin,</hi> Grandſon to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was by <hi>Parliament Crown'd King,</hi> tho' there was of that <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> Race in Being. <hi>Charlemain</hi>'s and <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>'s <hi>beſt,</hi> if not <hi>only</hi> Title, was the Choice of the People.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44281:140"/>
So that I wonder the <hi>French</hi> Writers ſhould queſtion the Legality of the late Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> ſince if we look back into the Original of other <hi>Kings,</hi> and how they came to their Crowns,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King William</hi>'s Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is as <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>beſt,</hi> and much <hi>better</hi> than ſome now Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Europe;</hi> for if all the <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> that have ſucceeded ſuch <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> or <hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> have been <hi>Unlawful,</hi> and <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd,</hi> there is not <hi>one Monarch</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> in all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay, ſcarce in the <hi>whole</hi> World, that can ſay they have a <hi>Lawful</hi> Authority, but muſt acknowledge (according to the Doctrine of <hi>D' Orleance</hi>) that they are all Uſurpers: Which I wonder he had the <hi>Confidence</hi> to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſince he cannot be ignorant that the <hi>French</hi> Kings enjoy their Crowns in Conſequence of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications</hi> and <hi>Depoſitions</hi> of their <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> and the People's <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> which ſucceeded thoſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>King</hi> William<hi>'s Title to the Crown of</hi> England, is as good as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44281:140"/>
King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s to <hi>France,</hi> if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for their own <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> give great Suſpicion of <hi>Unfair</hi> Dealings, and <hi>Sly</hi> Practices in the <hi>Elections</hi> of ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Kings; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Envy</hi> it ſelf, nor the moſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate</hi> of all our Enemies, could ever object it againſt King <hi>William,</hi> that by any <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Force,</hi> or <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Corruption,</hi> he endeavour'd to work on the <hi>Members</hi> of either <hi>Houſe,</hi> to labour his own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that it was the <hi>Free Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Majority, after long Debates and Conſultations on other Expedients.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty did not, like King <hi>Harold,</hi> lay Violent Hands upon a <hi>Crown;</hi> but only <hi>Accepted</hi> it when it was <hi>Offer'd:</hi> And, which ſhews his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he receiv'd it too on the <hi>Conditions</hi> that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd with it; which gives us a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſurance of the <hi>Regularity</hi> of his Government.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Vertue</hi> and his <hi>Merit</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to <hi>England,</hi> by their <hi>Free Election</hi> he was made <hi>King,</hi> and that is the <hi>Right</hi> he Claims by; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt <hi>Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Lawful,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:44281:141"/>
that can be without a Miracle, it makes out <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to him become our Indiſpencible Duty. But</p>
            <p>That which I but hinted before, and now comes to Crown all the reſt, and put it quite out of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for ever, is, <hi>It was God's Doing, the Immediate Hand of Heaven was in it:</hi> And, truly, nothing leſs could have accompliſh'd ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Things.</p>
            <p>We all know what the Nation <hi>Felt,</hi> and <hi>Fear'd;</hi> the Overturning of this Church, and the Subverting this Government.

            <p>That when the <hi>Deſign</hi> of our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> was Form'd, and Eſſaying, there ſhould be ſo extraordinary a Concurrence of all <hi>Favourable</hi> Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and diſpoſing all Men's Minds the ſame Way: That the <hi>Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of our <hi>Perſecutors</hi> in opening their Ill Deſigns ſo <hi>Early,</hi>

we therefore wholly lay aſide that <hi>Evangelical</hi> Precept?

abus'd, or miſ-apply'd, in former Reigns, <hi>Obedience to Princes is the Doctrine of the Bible,</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpencible Duty of Subjects to their Sovereign:</hi> And therefore upon that Head I will here endeavour to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it.</p>
            <p>You cannot be ignorant what a <hi>Character</hi> our Enemies give us, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are as <hi>Unchangeable</hi> as the <hi>Wind,</hi> and as <hi>Unconſtant</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome</hi> as the <hi>Waves</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> that are always <hi>Fluctuating,</hi> and daſhing themſelves to pieces. <hi>Fickleneſs</hi> is the Reproach of our Nation abroad, and has render'd us <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Cheap</hi> amongſt other Nations.</p>
            <p>Now an Opportunity is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Hands to confute thoſe <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,</hi> by a Stability in our <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> to ſuch a <hi>King,</hi> and Subjection to ſuch a <hi>Government,</hi> as all <hi>Europe</hi> admire and envy us for.</p>
            <p>Now we have an Advantage to ſhew our Complaints again the <hi>late King</hi> were <hi>True,</hi> and that the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them were <hi>Real;</hi> and may gain a <hi>Reputation</hi> of our Conduct, when we ſhew by our Actions, that as we had the <hi>Prudence</hi> to change

ſo much for the <hi>better,</hi> ſo we have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to know when we are well, and the <hi>Honeſty</hi> to continue ſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> reproach our <hi>Religion</hi> with <hi>Diſloyalty;</hi> and therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have <hi>ſtruggl'd</hi> ſo hard to keep it, we ought to ſhew it was <hi>worth</hi> Contending for, and wipe off that Aſpertion, by extolling its Vertue, becauſe, amongſt other Excellencies, it obliges us to a <hi>Fermety</hi> in our <hi>Allegiance,</hi> beyond all other Motives in the World; and that upon a Religious Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chiefly, we build and maintain our Duty to the <hi>King;</hi> and tho' Lower Conſiderations have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Place, and Value, yet that the Grand and <hi>Durable</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ſpring from thoſe Sacred Maxims.

Obedience to their Sovereign Lord <hi>King William;</hi> for this is all the Requital and Compenſation they can make to <hi>His Majeſty</hi> for all his Favours, and Care of them, and would in ſome meaſure <hi>ſweeten</hi> and <hi>aleviate</hi> the Burthen of them.</p>
            <p>Shall I be allow'd to ſay one thing without Offence, or Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Flattery; That if ever any <hi>King</hi> might expect <hi>Chearful</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from us for his <hi>Own</hi> ſake, or claim it for <hi>God</hi>'s ſake, <hi>King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> that now Governs us may do it juſtly; <hi>His Majeſty's Great and Glorious Undertaking, His Indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Pains, His Toilſom Days, His Reſtleſs Nights, His Anxious Cares in preventing the Deſigns of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Rival Princes, His Rare and Diſtinguiſh'd Wiſdom and Conduct,</hi> has bleſs'd us with ſo <hi>happy</hi> a Change, that even our <hi>Intereſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines with our <hi>Duty,</hi> and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with it.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, we have now a <hi>King</hi> that is a <hi>Defender of our Faith,</hi> a <hi>Sovereign</hi> to whom it hath ſo far approv'd it ſelf, as he hath given the Nation all imaginable Security
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44281:147"/>
of our <hi>Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and that they ſhall never be again in danger of being <hi>depriv'd</hi> of them for the future; in which all good Men <hi>Rejoice</hi> and <hi>Triumph,</hi> and no Men doubt the Sincerity of it, but thoſe whoſe own Guilt renders them always <hi>Suſpitious,</hi> and <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of all Mankind. Add hereto, that as His Majeſty's Perſonal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits has engag'd our Obedience, ſo are we alſo oblig'd to it by that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Providence</hi> that has ſtill atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Miracles of it <hi>guarded</hi> his Sacred Perſon through all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and Dangers of War, and ſet His Majeſty on a ſteady Throne in <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Plain and Viſible then is the Argument for <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> in our Caſe? And how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ought it to work upon <hi>this</hi> Generation, when the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Kindneſſes on Earth <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> and when <hi>Miracles</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven command our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Thus are we oblig'd to obey <hi>King William</hi> for his own ſake: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains alſo as a Duty upon us, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44281:147"/>
we obey His Majeſty for <hi>God</hi>'s ſake, and that, I hope, will keep it firm in this wavering Generation: I mean, when our Subjection is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where it truly ought to be, <hi>viz. upon Reaſons of Religion, upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Conſcience, and Duty to God;</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>Submitting for the Lord's ſake.</hi> And I hope I need not dwell long upon this Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians; for if the plain Principles of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> may be allow'd to be a Rule of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>God</hi>'s immediate Commands do lay any <hi>Obligations</hi> upon us, then it is evident that Men are as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ty'd to the Duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prince in point of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as to any other Duty whatſoever. Let Conſcience be as <hi>Free</hi> as Men aſſert it to be, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God only, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſpenc'd withall in this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For if <hi>Government</hi> be <hi>God</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <hi>Kings</hi> his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> and that he hath charg'd <hi>all Men</hi> to be obedient to them, and their Lawful Commands, upon pain of <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and his higheſt Diſpleaſure; then I am ſure, if Conſcience be an
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44281:148"/>
honeſt Reſpect to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Laws,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily oblige all Men in this Inſtance. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood the Obligation of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or were able to direct the Obedience of it, no more need be added on this Subject, than to deſire Men to open their <hi>Bibles,</hi> and Read their Duty from thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; tho' if need were, I might appeal to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> the Conſonant <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> too, of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> and <hi>Beſt</hi> Chriſtians, to Vouch the Truth of Obedience to <hi>Kings</hi> for the Lord's ſake: And therefore I ſhall cloſe up this Diſcourſe with my Hearty Wiſhes</p>
